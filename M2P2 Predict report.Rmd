## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Summary of assignment
```investigate if customer responses to some survey questions (e.g. income, age, etc.) enable us to predict the answer to the brand preference question. If we can do this with confidence, I would like you to make those predictions and provide the sales team with a complete view of what brand our customers prefer.

To do this, I would like you to run and optimize at least two different decision tree classification methods in R - C5.0 and RandomForest - and compare which one works better for this data set.
```
